# Sample code to reproduce a .NET MAUI Button bug where it doesn't draw borders

### Description

The Button.BorderColor property does not seem to work on some platforms. Adding `BorderColor="Black"` to the XAML for a Button control seems to have no effect on macOS or Android.

### Steps to Reproduce

Create a new .NET MAUI app and replace the contents of MainPage.xaml with this:

```
    <HorizontalStackLayout>
        <Button BackgroundColor="LightBlue" BorderColor="Black" HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" />
        <Button BackgroundColor="LightBlue" HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" />
        <Button BackgroundColor="LightBlue" BorderColor="Black" HeightRequest="100" WidthRequest="100" />
    </HorizontalStackLayout>
```

and remove the OnCounterClicked method from MainPage.xaml.cs. 


Run the app on macOS:

`dotnet build -t:Run -f net8.0-maccatalyst`

The borders do not show up on the buttons with `BorderColor="Black"`:

They don't show up on Android either:

Here's the same XAML rendered in Windowsâ€”it works correctly:
